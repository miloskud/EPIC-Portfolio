## EPIC Experience

### Pi's and Python
* Write a summary of what you learned in this course.  
* Be sure to incorporate your use of professional workforce readiness skills in addition to the content you learned.

The main things that I learned in this class were how to code in python, and how to work with a raspberry pi. I then learned how to put together these two skills in order to make my own unique project. Throughout the course of this class, I also gained several professional skills. For example, I learned that keeping a professional environment is key to maintaining productivity.

### Workforce Readiness

- What did you learn through these skills being part of EPIC?

Through the workforce readiness system, the most important thing that I learned is that being prepared, on time, and ready to stay focussed are all invaluable to maintaining a professional and productive environment.

### Professional Experiences
- Work Site tours
- Job shadowing
- Conferences
- Professional Organizations
Through this EPIC course, we got the opportunity to visit the office and warehouse of the Denver-based computer company, System76. In this tour, we were able to see the behind the scenes aspects of producing and optimizing the products, as well as the front end aspects of customer service. System76 is an incredible company, which is founded on the idea of being completely open source. I thought that it was incredible that a company with this business model can be so successful.
