## EPIC Experience

### Pi's and Python
* Write a summary of what you learned in this course.  
* Be sure to incorporate your use of professional workforce readiness skills in addition to the content you learned.

The main things that I learned in this class were how to code in python, and how to work with a raspberry pi. I then learned how to put together these two skills in order to make my own unique project. Throughout the course of this class, I also gained several professional skills. For example, I learned that keeping a professional environment is key to maintaining productivity.

### Workforce Readiness

- What did you learn through these skills being part of EPIC?

Through the workforce readiness system, the most important thing that I learned is that being prepared, on time, and ready to stay focussed are all invaluable to maintaining a professional and productive environment.

### Professional Experiences
- Work Site tours
- Job shadowing
- Conferences
- Professional Organizations

Through this EPIC course, we got the opportunity to visit the office and warehouse of the Denver-based computer company, System76. In this tour, we were able to see the behind the scenes aspects of producing and optimizing the products, as well as the front end aspects of customer service. System76 is an incredible company, which is founded on the idea of being completely open source. I thought that it was incredible that a company with this business model can be so successful.

## Projects: 
- Final Project - https://github.com/miloskud/Tic-Tac-Toe-Project
	 - Describe the project and it's purpose
For my final project, I knew that I wanted to do something that I could have fun with, and that I would personally like to have for myself. For this reason, I made a miniature game of Tic Tac Toe with a few twists. 1. It is played on a mitiature screen with a 3 button control system. 2. Instead of the traditional game of Tic-Tac-Toe, I decided to make it a 5x5 version that I have been having fun playing recently with my friends. This version of Tic-Tac-Toe requires 4 in a row to win. I have found that this version is significantly more engaging and exciting. There are a variety of traps that can be done, which will garuntee a win if not caught by your opponent.

	- Describe what skills you used and what you learned during this project

The most important skill that I had to use for this project was time management. I had a fairly limited timeframe to complete a fairly ambitions project. For this reason, it was very necessary that I stayed on task and used my time wisely. Without this skill, my project likely would be unfinished. Some other skills that I needed were perceverance, the ability to solve problems, and a general knowledge of coding in python.
